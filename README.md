JavaDungeons is a Fabric mod that adds content from Minecraft Dungeons into Minecraft: Java Edition!

### Texture Rights

Most textures are ripped from Minecraft: Dungeons. All textures belong to their respective owners. Some have to be edited and adjusted manually by me due to how they handle texturing and materials in Dungeons. All models are based off of their ingame model files, or roughly approximated to come as close as possible. 

### Naming of blocks

All blocks are named based on what I think they're closest to in Minecraft, unless they have a proper name in Dungeons. Blocks are categorized under where they're found most ingame, unless it's found in multiple locations, in which case it'll just be put under a general category. If you have any issue with how blocks are categorized or named, please don't hesitate to post an issue about it!

### What will be added from Dungeons?

Mostly decoration blocks, biomes, and weapons. Blocks & weapons with small color variations or shape variations from vanilla blocks will not be added, due to their similarity to already-existing items.
